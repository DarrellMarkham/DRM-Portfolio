            Hello I am Darrell.<br> I have been around computers and the data processing industry for over 40 years. 
  
  My Mother was a Data Processor (Keypunch Operator) when I was young. By the time I began my Junior year of Highschool my Mother was the teacher for the Data Processing curiculom where I learned COBOL, Fortan IV, and RPG.
  
  After Highschool I drifted away from computers until the personal computer was becoming affordable to the masses. When I purchased my first PC, an Acer with a Pentium 160 processor I again fell in love with computers. It wasn't long before I became a strong user of most Microsoft applications.
  
  I am now a Project Manager implementing cloud based SaaS solutions and have a desire to learn about how these applications are constructed. I a not changing industries, I love being a PM, but simply want a better understanding of what is being communicate3d during echnical meetings discussing a product or process.
